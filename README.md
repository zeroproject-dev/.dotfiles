# Dotfiles for archlinux

# Installation

For the installation, is preferred to use a clean archlinux installation.
iN the iso of archlinux was a option named "desktop type", I recommend to use the "Xorg" Option.
And after installation, you can run the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL dot.zeroproject.dev)"
```
